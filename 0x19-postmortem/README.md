<h1>0x19. Postmortem</h1>

Software development project postmortem brings people together to discuss the details of an incident: why it happened, its impact, what actions were taken to mitigate it and resolve it, and what should be done to prevent it from happening again.
A project post-mortem is performed at the conclusion of a project to determine and analyze elements of the project that were successful or unsuccessful, the process as lessons learned.
Project post-mortems are intended to inform process improvements which mitigate future risks and to promote iterative best practices.

Bringing people together to engage in a structured, collaborative process allows everyone to reflect and contribute what they learned and can build trust and resiliency within your team. And documenting the incident and how the team remedied it can inform how future incidents are handled. It helps drive continuous improvement.

One important detail â€“ postmortem is not about assigning blame. You should be finding process failures not personal failures.
